                <li>1. Taxes are not included in pricing tables on the payment page. Pricing/payments MUST be discussed before beginning any jobs in order to avoid any confusion 
                    when the invoice is sent to the client. Timed pricing is our default billing type if no type of pricing is specified.
                    Prices are also subject to change without notice. 
                </li>
                <li>2. Tech Rehab is not obligated to honour our prices shown as some jobs require much more work; TechRehab also reserves the right to decline any job. 
                    Travel time will be billed for clients outside our support area, as seen on our support map shown on the bottom of our home page.</li>
                <li>3. Software is not supplied by TechRehab, they must be supplied by the client or paid in advance to TechRehab so we can source them for the client.  
                    Tech Rehab is 100% NOT RESPONSIBLE for the the use of illegal software, or any issues involving third party softwware; This is COMPLETELY the clients
                    responsibility.
                </li>
                <li>4. It is the clients responsibility to have a secure internet connection in order for TechRehab to help remotely. If this is not posssible and an on site visit is required
                    the client will NOT be billed for remote support, they will be billed for an on-site visit instead. 
                </li>
                <li>5. The maximum time per visit will be 2.5 hours unless discussed in prior before our It Specialist is at the location. 
                    Every support plan is limited to one location unless specified in our contract.  
                    All support plans will be responded to within 1 business day depending on the circumstance. 
                    There is also no guarantee of a resolution as each support request is circumstantial. 
                       
                </li>
                <li>
                   6.  Any extra support time that is outside of your plans time will be billed at our standard on-site rate depending on if the client is a business or a residential client. 
                     Any unused support hours or on site visits from one month EXPIRES and will NOT carry over to the next month. All terms can be negotiated at the time of a contract signing.
                </li>
                <li>7. All contracts must be paid on the first of each month, if you would like to cancel your contract with TechRehab this will require a one month notice. 
                    The response time for any of our Support Plans are in no way binding, the time depends on each circumstance and availability of both the client and our it technicians.</li>  
                <li>8. All invoice payments that are overdue by 2 weeks will have a 10% service fee added on to the initial invoice, 
                    this service fee will repeat every 2 weeks until the initial invoice is paid.</li>
